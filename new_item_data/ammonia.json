    "description": "An industrial-sized bottle of ammonia.  This could be useful with something else, but probably not in this large a quantity.",
    "use": "This ammonia isn't very useful by itself and it doesn't make a great beverage.  You might be able to use it on something else though if you think back to your middle school science fair.",

    "throw": "You chuck the bottle and it clatters to the floor.  Luckily, it remains intact.",
    "taste": "You unscrew the cap and take a small sip, ignoring every part of your brain that is telling you to stop.  It tastes somehwat metallic in a most unpleasant way.",
    "touch": "You run your fingers over the bottle.  It's a thick, sturdy plastic with a smooth surface.",
    "smell": "You don't need to do much to catch a whiff once you open the cap.  It smells like a combination of urine, sweat, dead fish, and regret.  Your nose and throat burns a bit.",
    "shake": "You vigorously shake the large plastic bottle.  The contents slosh around a bit but settle quickly.",
