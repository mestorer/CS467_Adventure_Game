GAME_INTRO = '''
Welcome to "Corporate Conspiracy"!\n
In the mundane world of PrestoCorp, you are just an ordinary office worker, 
but your patience is wearing thin. Dealing with the never-ending demands of 
your overbearing boss and navigating the treacherous corporate politics is 
draining your enthusiasm.\n
But today is different. As you enter the parking lot, you decide it's time 
for a change. Your goal is simpleâ€”avoid getting fired at all costs. You've 
had enough of being a pawn in the corporate game, and now it's time to take
matters into your own hands.\n
As you head to your desk in the Marketing Department, you discover a dreaded 
"Notice of Disciplinary Action" waiting for you. Your heart races as you wonder 
who might be trying to sabotage you and how you can turn the tables on them.\n
Welcome, and good luck!'''
