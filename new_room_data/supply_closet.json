    "name": "Supply Closet",
    "description": "The Supply Closet is a small, dimly lit room tucked away in a corner of the reception area. It is cluttered with various supplies and equipment, stacked haphazardly on the shelves. The air inside is slightly musty, but the [air vent] keeps the smell from being overpowering. The walls are old and faded, and a flickering light bulb adds to the eerie atmosphere. You notice a mop and a bucket, a box of matches, and a plastic bottle among the items in the closet.",
