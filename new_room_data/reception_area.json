    "description": "The Reception Area of PrestoCorp exudes a professional and efficient atmosphere, with polished marble floors, contemporary decor, and a sleek desk manned by a diligent receptionist. The room is well-organized, featuring a waiting area with plush leather couches and a selection of business journals. Access to certain areas is closely monitored through a high-tech Keycard Terminal. As you glance around the room, your keen eye catches something unexpectedâ€”a key lying inconspicuously on the floor near the desk. It's a curious find, and you can't shake the feeling that it may come in handy. The receptionist remains focused on her duties, unaware of your observation.",
